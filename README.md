# qubership-virtual-secretary

### Local Development
To connect to DB using [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) use following tips:
1. Select H2 Embedded type of the database
2. Go to "Driver settings" -> "Libraries"
   1. Remove existing driver (if exists)
   2. Click "Add artifact"
   3. Paste maven declaration for H2 into "Dependency Declaration", i.e.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.224</version>
</dependency>
```
   4. Apply settings
3. URL = jdbc:h2:{PATH_TO_DB_FILE};CIPHER=AES
4. Username
5. Password field consists of two passwords: FILE_PASSWORD + ONE SPACE + USER_PASSWORD
6. Test Connection
7. Finish

### Setup
#### all-qs-members.json
List of team members to be notified is managed via "ALL_QS_MEMBERS" secret.
It must contain JSON structure, like:
```json
{
  "qubership-members" : [ {
    "email" : "user1@example.com",
    "full-name" : "FirstName1 LastName1",
    "lead-full-name" : "LeadFirstName1 LeadLastName1",
    "lead-email" : "lead1@example.com"
  }, {
    "email" : "user2@example.com",
    "full-name" : "FirstName2 LastName2",
    "lead-full-name" : "LeadFirstName2 LeadLastName2",
    "lead-email" : "lead2@example.com"
  }
}
```

During the run, the content of this secret will be mounted into a local temp file, which is mentioned in the app.properties.
See details in the ./.github/workflows/main.yml action file.
