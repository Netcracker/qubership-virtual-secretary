# qubership-virtual-secretary

### Local development
To connect to the DB using [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/), use the following steps:
1. Select the H2 Embedded database type.
2. Go to "Driver settings/properties" -> "Libraries":
   1. Remove the existing driver (if any).
   2. Click "Add artifact".
   3. Paste the Maven declaration for H2 into "Dependency Declaration", i.e.:

      ```xml
      <dependency>
          <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
          <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
          <version>2.2.224</version>
      </dependency>
      ```

   4. Apply settings.
3. URL = `jdbc:h2:${CORRECT_PATH}\qubership-virtual-secretary\data\mapdb.db;CIPHER=AES`
4. Enter the username.
5. Password field consists of two passwords: `FILE_PASSWORD` + one space + `USER_PASSWORD`.
6. Test connection.
7. Finish.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to set 'DEBUG_ONLY_EMAIL_TO_SEND_MESSAGES' property in the app.properties file, cause messges via 
> Mattermost bot will be sending during application run. So, not to spam everybody - jsut send messages to you only.
> For such purposes - set your email-address in the mentioned property. The email address will be used to define
> your Mattermost account.

### Setup
#### all-qs-members.json
List of team members to be notified is managed via the `ALL_QS_MEMBERS` secret.
It must contain a JSON structure, like:
```json
{
  "qubership-members": [
    {
      "email": "user1@example.com",
      "full-name": "FirstName1 LastName1",
      "lead-full-name": "LeadFirstName1 LeadLastName1",
      "lead-email": "lead1@example.com"
    },
    {
      "email": "user2@example.com",
      "full-name": "FirstName2 LastName2",
      "lead-full-name": "LeadFirstName2 LeadLastName2",
      "lead-email": "lead2@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

During the run, the content of this secret will be mounted into a local temp file, which is referenced in `app.properties`.
See details in the `./.github/workflows/main.yml` action file.

#### app.properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use Windows-style paths delimiters then put "\\" double slashes, i.e. "c:\\\\temp\\\\my_prompt.txt"
